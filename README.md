## Overview of the statistical analysis:

The purpose of the analysis is to analyze weather data to determine if it would be worth it to open a surf and shake shop on the island of O'ahu. I used SQLite to conduct a query for the temperatures in the months of June and December. 

## Results:

Three three key differences in weather between June and December on the island are:
1. The mean temperature in June is higher than in December (74.9 vs. 71.0 degrees Fahrenheit).
2. The minimum temperature in June is higher than in December (64 vs. 56 degrees Fahrenheit).
3. The maximum temperature in June is higher than in December (85 vs. 56 degrees Fahrenheit).

There are more data points for June temperatures compared to December (1700 recorded temperatures vs. 1517 recorded temperatures).

## Summary:

Precipitation data for June:

Precipitation statistics for December:

From examining this temperature data, the temperature would still be good for surfing and ice cream in December. 

Some additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December include precipitation, wind speeds, swell/wave sizes, water temperature, and the number and density of surf shops and ice cream/shave ice/frozen dessert shops already in business in the desired area. 

Seeing how O'ahu's weather conditions in December (according to this set of data) are still favorable, it would be a good idea to invest in this enterprise. Another positive is that there tends to be an increase in tourists in December for the holidays. 

It would be ideal to select a location for the surf and shake shop where there are more tourists and average surfing conditions, as opposed to on the North Shore of the island where the waves can be extremely high, especially during the winter, and likely a higher percentage of local surfers (who likely use their own surfboards and would mainly patronize the shop for the food/shakes).

The benefits vs. costs of setting up the shop in the most popular area Waikiki may be worth it for the profits. More analysis can be done to examine other factors so that the business venture is as successful as possible.
